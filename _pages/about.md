I am a second year Ph.D. student at Macau University of Science and Technology, where I have the fortune of being advised by Professor [MengChu Zhou](https://scholar.must.edu.mo/scholar/100125).

### Research Directions

**Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF)**: Our research in MAPF focuses on planning conflict-free paths for multiple agents in shared environments. The goal is to minimize total path length and optimize various objectives, with applications in robotic teamwork, warehouse logistics, and more. We emphasize efficient resolution of path conflicts among agents.

**Multi-Objective Optimization Problems**: We explore multi-objective optimization algorithms that tackle multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. Our work encompasses evolutionary algorithms, multi-objective genetic algorithms, and Pareto optimization, aiming to identify balanced solution sets for applications in engineering design, resource allocation, and decision support systems.

**Task Allocation Problems**: Our research addresses task allocation, which involves distributing tasks among agents or resources to enhance system efficiency and completion rates. This area has applications in manufacturing and service systems, where we focus on developing efficient algorithms and strategies for effective task distribution.
